	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>Hello?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Hello, ma'am.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>…Stephanie.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>I won't bother to ask how you got this number.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>We need to talk.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>You were told not to make contact.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I know you're hurting, ma'am. I know you feel betrayed.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>I trusted you. Each and every one of you. With my life. Can you even imagine how I feel right now, Steph?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>We never betrayed that trust. Never. Why do you think the General did what he did?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>…</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>He did it because he knew you'd never do what had to be done. You were blind and it was going to kill you. Going to kill our organization.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>It was reckless and idiotic and he defied my direct orders! We would have found another way.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Would we?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>There's always another way. Always!</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Every heavy-kill protocol on the books failed. Civilians died because of that nuke you set off in <em>[CR: OSAKA WHITE]</em>. Innocents died. Because you wouldn't use the one tool we knew could resolve the situation. Because you couldn't!</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>And how many are going to die now, Stephanie!? We have no means to predict the behavior of the Omicron Device. Especially after Syracuse. We have no idea what you unleashed when you chose to defy my orders!</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>What would we have unleashed if we hadn't? The Stockholm group is turning our assets and now they've got Kawasaki on board. Kawasaki, for God's sake! If we lost the ability to keep them in check — well. You knew Rin. You knew firsthand what she was capable of.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Maybe we would have found another way. But would it have happened in time? We were losing materiel and personnel right and left. We needed to check 291-Golf before our ability to act on the international stage was compromised. Stockholm only needed one opening. Anthony denied it to them.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>Rin's a monster. Carlucci's a monster. But they're human, mostly. They're the devil we know. And damn it, Stephanie, I'd take a hundred Carluccis over­— over—</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>You can't keep blaming yourself for Nicole's death, Yuki.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>…</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>I…</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I've known you for ­— how many years has it been? Ten now? That was the only time I've ever seen you cry.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>You were an inspiration to us all. We all admired you. You and Nicole. I've watched Anthony order refugees shelled and embassies burned in cold blood, without a trace of emotion, but he was in tears when he gave the order this time.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I'd say "may he rest in peace" but God knows we're all going to hell.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I know this hurt you. But it hurt us too.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>Was that why you called? To try and — and justify this to me!?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>No.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Ma'am, I called to apologize.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I am so, so sorry.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>…what?</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>It was the right thing to do. And we'd all do it again. Even knowing what it would cost us personally.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>But I am so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. None of us did.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I hope one day you'll be able to see that.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>I…</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>I need to go.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>OUTBOUND</th><td>You can't call me again.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>I know.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>But you have my number.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>You have everyone's number.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>And I'll be here when you need me.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>INBOUND</th><td>Take care, ma'am.</td></tr>

	<tr><th>David MacAdam</th><td>Well, we'll find out.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>David MacAdam</th><td>Because I'm taking her off the project, suspending her for professional misconduct, and filing a complaint with the CRB.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>David MacAdam</th><td>Lying to superiors is supposed to be the sort of thing you get your clearance pulled for.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>David MacAdam</th><td>Or at least it was back when I joined up.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>David MacAdam</th><td>Back when I could still recognize this goddamned place.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Katherine Jian</th><td>jesus, david</td></tr>

<h1>Orientation Speech (Transcript)</h1>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>You have all been brought here tonight on one pretext or another. Regretfully, I was required to conceal the true purpose of this convocation for reasons you will soon understand.</p>
<p>No, you may not leave.</p>
<p>Ladies. Gentlemen. The rumors are true. The first and previous Committee has been dissolved, and it falls to me as the leader of our little organization to fill the seats that now lie empty. I have seen fit to select you.</p>
<p>Sit <i>down.</i></p>
<p>I have selected you after exhaustive vetting, and I have worked with many of you personally at one time or another. I am placing my trust, and the trust the Department has placed in me, in you. You are all each of you leaders.</p>
<p>Admiral Fyodorov, your exploits in the Baltic Sea are the stuff of legend to this day, and so I have selected you as the new supreme leader of our naval forces.</p>
<p>Countess Carrington, your work as a spymaster in Western Europe has benefitted our organization more than you could possibly imagine, and it is past time your true talents were acknowledged. I have therefore chosen you to direct our intelligence services worldwide.</p>
<p>Ms. Madison, well… let me just say, your… <i>special</i> talents have not gone unnoticed. I know further praise would only serve to embarass you. And I expect you knoe exactly which division I am placing you in command of.</p>
<p>General López, there is no finer leader of men among the living. I would therefore take it as a personal favor if you would lend your talents to the role of Grand Marshal.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, my dear… I have long been honored to count you as a friend, and I hope I can now count you as our new head of information systems.</p>
<p>Sir Rothschild, your skill as a perverter of words and artisan of untruth knows no equal, and I thereby appoint you as our new chief of propaganda.</p>
<p>And finally, Mrs. Jones! Dear Mrs. Jones. I’m sure you’ve all heard her name from time to time, haven’t you? Mrs. Jones — may I call you Daisy? — I would like to invite you to take up the mantle of Director of Research and Development. Your expertise in bioweapons will in particular be appreciated after the recent mishap at the Tunguska Facility. I would take it as a kindness, however, if you refrained from bringing further… <i>samples</i> to future meetings.</p>
<p>As of this moment, each of you has been granted Osaka White clearance befitting your new status. Your codeword clearances are no longer relevant, and you have been moved to Paygrade C-1. I have prepared thorough briefings on each department’s current organizational paradigm, true history, disposition of forces, current projects, and most pertinent challenges. They are each no longer than seven hundred pages, and I expect you to have all familiarized yourselves with them by no later than 0700 tomorrow morning, at which time the first official session of the Second Committee will be held. Offices, and, should you desire them, quarters at Osaka Base have been allotted to you, and you will now each become one of only fifteen people alive permitted to know its true location.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>Yes, this reassignment is mandatory.</p>
